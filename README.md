## 📌 Project Overview

The **Breach Exposure Analyzer** is an automated security analysis tool that simulates real-world incident response workflows. It scrapes exposed employee data from a public source, evaluates Social Security Number (SSN) exposure risk using an external API, and generates structured outputs for reporting and mitigation.

The system produces:
- A structured CSV risk report
- Automated alert emails for high-risk individuals
- Summary statistics for incident analysis
